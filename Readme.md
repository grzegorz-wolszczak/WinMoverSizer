#### WinMoverSizer

WinMoverSizer is a simple background application that makes it easy to resize and move windows on desktop using mouse.
To do that you hold down the Alt key, and Left-click to move a window, Right-click to resize it; **and from anywhere inside the window**.
This program was inspired by [KDE Mover-Sizer](https://corz.org/windows/software/accessories/KDE-resizing-moving-for-Windows.php) which itself was inspired by [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 

#### How to use
- Hold LeftAlt+ LeftMouseButton to move window
- Hold LeftAlt + RightMouseButton to resize window

#### Why another program like this ?
I used to work for a company (in the financial domain) that had very strict limitations on what could be installed on company laptops. If an application wasn't on the approved list, it couldn't be used. I had always relied on the KDE-mover-sizer application and couldn't imagine life without it. When I was cut off from it, the only option left for me was to write my own open-source application that provided a similar experience, as I could run such an application.
